Project Title: DevDetective - GitHub User Data Fetcher with Dark/Light Mode

The DevDetective project aims to create a user-friendly web application that leverages the GitHub API to fetch and display user data from GitHub profiles. In addition, the application will feature a user-customizable dark and light mode, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

Key Features:

1. GitHub Data Retrieval:
   The core functionality of DevDetective is to allow users to input GitHub usernames and retrieve relevant information from their profiles. The application will fetch 
   data such as user details, repositories, followers, following, and contributions.

2. User Profile Display:
   The fetched GitHub data will be presented in a visually appealing and organized manner on the user interface. This will include profile images, bio, location, social 
   links, and other profile-related information.

3. Repository Overview:
   The application will provide an overview of the repositories owned by the user, displaying key information like repository name, description, language, stars, and 
   forks. Users can click on a repository to view more detailed information.

4. Dark/Light Mode:
   DevDetective will offer users the option to switch between dark and light modes. This feature enhances usability by allowing users to choose the mode that best suits 
   their preferences and reduces eye strain during extended usage.

5. Search and Navigation:
   The application will incorporate a search feature that enables users to quickly find specific GitHub profiles. Additionally, intuitive navigation and user-friendly UI components will facilitate seamless interaction with the application.

6. Responsive Design:
   DevDetective will be designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that the application works flawlessly across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

7. Error Handling:
   In cases where the GitHub API requests fail due to rate limiting or other issues, the application will provide appropriate error messages and guidance to users on how to resolve the issue.

8. User Authentication (Optional):
   For an enhanced user experience, optional user authentication can be implemented. Authenticated users may have access to additional features such as saving favorite profiles, viewing personalized recommendations, and more.

9. Data Caching and Performance:
   To improve performance and reduce the load on the GitHub API, DevDetective can implement data caching strategies to store previously fetched user data and update it periodically.

10. Privacy and Security:
    The application will prioritize user data privacy and security, ensuring that sensitive information is handled responsibly and that communication with the GitHub API is secure.

Technologies:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.
- React.js or Vue.js for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- Node.js or Python for server-side logic and API integration.
- GitHub API for fetching user data.
- OAuth or token-based authentication for optional user authentication.
- Local storage or caching libraries for data storage and retrieval.
- UI libraries/frameworks for enhancing visual appeal and user experience.

By combining the power of GitHub API data retrieval with an intuitive user interface and the flexibility of dark and light modes, DevDetective will provide developers and GitHub enthusiasts with an engaging and valuable tool for exploring GitHub profiles and repositories.
